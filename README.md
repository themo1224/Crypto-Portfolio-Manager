# Crypto Portfolio Manager

**Crypto Portfolio Manager** is an open-source admin panel built with [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) to simulate cryptocurrency portfolio management. The project is designed for users and developers who want to manage a simulated crypto portfolio, track token balances, and learn blockchain basics without using real cryptocurrency.

This project is beginner-friendly and focuses on learning blockchain concepts, PHP development, and admin panel design. It is built with international usage in mind and leverages blockchain testnets and APIs for safe and accessible development.

## Features

- üåç **Real-Time Token Data**: Fetch live token prices and updates using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
- üíº **Simulated Portfolio Management**: Add, update, and delete cryptocurrencies in the portfolio.
- üîó **Blockchain Testnet Integration**: Interact with Ethereum testnets (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) and simulate wallet functionality.
- üìä **Transaction History**: View simulated transaction history with mock data.
- üìà **Charts and Analytics**: Visualize portfolio trends and token price movements.
- üîí **Secure and Decentralized**: Use MetaMask for wallet simulation and interact with decentralized tools.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**:
   - Use MetaMask to connect to the Ethereum testnet (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia).
   - Request testnet tokens from a [faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).

2. **Manage Portfolio**:
   - Add tokens to your portfolio.
   - Track token prices and portfolio value.

3. **Simulate Transactions**:
   - View mock transaction history.
   - Experiment with sending and receiving test tokens.

4. **Analyze Trends**:
   - Use built-in charts to analyze token performance and portfolio trends.
